# Kalman Filter Fun!

### (WIP)

The Kalman filter is a recursive optimal estimation algorithm, designed to solve the discrete-data filtering problem. It has enabled significant advancements in modern control theory, GNC systems, computer vision, signal processing, voice recognition, and much more. I got particularly interested in it after reading about it in "Controls Engineering in the FIRST Robotics Competition" by Tyler Veness. I decided to try making an application of a linear Kalman filter in Python. Luckily, there are lots of robust implementations online so I had plenty of help!

I got much-needed help from The Kalman Filter website (yes, there is an entire website dedicated to this) and Machine Learning Space's implementation

### CAUTION: The code in its current iteration is BROKEN! I added acceleration as a new parameter and everything is falling apart. Yay!
