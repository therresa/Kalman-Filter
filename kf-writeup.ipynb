    "The Kalman filter is a recursive optimal estimation algorithm, designed to solve the discrete-data filtering problem. It has enabled significant advancements in modern control theory, GNC systems, computer vision, signal processing, voice recognition, and much more. I got particularly interested in it after reading about it in \"Controls Engineering in the FIRST Robotics Competition\" by Tyler Veness. I decided to try making an application of a linear Kalman filter in Python. Luckily, there are lots of robust implementations online so I had plenty of help!\n",
    "\n",
    "I got much-needed help from The Kalman Filter website (yes, there is an entire website dedicated to this) and Machine Learning Space's implementation"

    "#### A Quick Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A Kalman filter works as a kind of black-box algorithm that can take noisy measurements or sensor data and \"fuse\" them together to create an estimation of some hidden or unobservable state. For example, if I wanted to determine the position of a car without direct visual access, I would take sensor output from the car's odometer, IMU, and and GPS data. However, if there was some obstacle obstructing the car from accurate GPS tracking, like if I was in some deep tunnel, my GPS data might be muddled and I'd get all sorts of inaccuracies in my car's position. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Kalman filter is able to take error and data variance into account and output a prediction of the unknown state - in this case, the car's position. The kick of it is that because it's recursive, it can continue to update dynamically and respond to changes in conditions, and iterate closer and closer to the most accurate state. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I decided to try a basic implementation of a linear Kalman filter that uses simulated noisy data as inputs. I followed a tutorial from The Kalman Filter, adapted the code to account for some really weird style and implementation choices, and am currently playing around with this working MVP!"
